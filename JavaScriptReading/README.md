# JavaScript Reading 

### Chapter 1 - Values, Types and Operators

1. Before this reading I didn't know almost anything about JavaScript and how this programming language actually works, but I relize there are some things that are in common with how humans communicate and write. For example, in this first chapter I already knew that computers can use both numbers and words to send information like doing calculations or showing words on the screen. 

2. I didn't know a lot of things but one that stood out the most is the fact that JavaScript receives numbers and text differently. For example, if you write a code that looks like this: `"5" + 1` the result would actually be 51 instead of 6.

### Chapter 2 - Program Structure 

1. I already knew that when you send instructions to a program you must send them with a very specific command and a very detailed explanation in order to make it work.
2. One thing I didn't know before the reading this chapter is that JavaScript doesn't always need semicolons at the end of every line (I though it did), but in some cases a missing semicolon can cause some issues.

### Chapter 3 - Functions

1. Something I was wondering while we were writing codes in class with the same indication in every line was if there's a way to "group" the same message to save time when coding, and in this chapter I found out that this is actually possible by grouping the same control, so I guess this is something I "almost" knew before the reading :)
2. To be completely honest I had no idea about what functions are so I'd say that everything was kind of new to me, but one thing that stood out was that functions are used to break big problems into small steps, and this also helps organize the code to make them easier.
