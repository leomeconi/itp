#Haiku Documentation Process

###Process

To create the .aiff file I opened the Terminal in my Mac. First step I decided where to adress the file so I used the command "cd documents" to open the documents folder. Then to make sure I was really there I typed "pwd" and the Terminal told me I was in hte documents folder.

###Code to create Audio

To create the audio file I typed the code "-v "Samantha" "*my Haiku poem*" -o Haiku.aiff".

###Upload

I uploaded the .aiff file that was saved in my Documents folder into the Haiku folder we created in class on GitHub.
