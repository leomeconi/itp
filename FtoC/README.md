# Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter

I started by creating two variables **f** and **c**.
Then I gave them a value by using the code: `let f = 99;` and `let c = (f - 32) * 5/9`.
To make the javaScript calculating this I used the code `console.log("temperature in Celsius: " +c);`. 
This is just to give me a result written with the first part as "Temperature in Celsius: " and the `+c` is to insert the value of c after that.
